Thanks for downloading myst!

Start new project:
1. Copy the "Base Structure" folder
2. Paste the folder where you want to have your project
3. Rename the folder in what ever you want
4. Now you have a basic structure to build your project faster

Use the myst Framework:
1. Copy the myst folder and put it inside of your project
2. Now you can import classes from myst, for example: import myst.swing.blueprint.ButtonBlueprint;
